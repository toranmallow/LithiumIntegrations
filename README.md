# Lithium Integrations

A companion mod to [Picklock](https://mods.factorio.com/user/t_picklock)'s [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) Mod [Lithium Polymer Accumulator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PicksLiPoAccu).  Its purpose is to provide integrations of the new Lithium ore type (and associated products) introduced by Picklock to other mods, making them part of recipes for more advanced items.  This gives the player more reasons to mine and refine Lithium.
